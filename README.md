# DynatraceAPIv2Client
Simple client to connect to the Dynatrace API v2 and will not require the SSL key to be imported into the JVM

Warning: this code implements a workaround which allows you to connect to a SSL end point without importing the SSL key into the JVM.  This method is NOT secure and allows a man in the middle attack.
